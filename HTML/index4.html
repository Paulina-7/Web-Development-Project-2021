    <h3>The Background</h3>
    <p>
        Warsaw is the current capital of Poland, inhabited by almost 2 million people. It is a particularly important city for Poles, mainly due to its old history. After World War II, Warsaw lay in ruins - almost 85% of the buildings were destroyed and turned to ash by the Nazis. Immediately after the end of the war, the city began an intensive reconstruction of the historic centre based on original plans. As a result, the baroque and renaissance merchant houses that can be seen today are perfect replicas of the original buildings from the past.
    </p>

    <p>
        Despite the outbreak of World War II, the city is very culturally rich and is home to over 60 different museums. The National Museum, which chronicles the history of the city, also houses the largest collection of paintings in Poland - including several works of art from the private collection of Adolf Hitler. In addition to art and history museums, there are also several equally interesting places in Warsaw, including the only Poster Museum in the world, a museum devoted to the Warsaw Uprising from World War II, the Neon Museum and the Museum of Caricature. 
    </p>

    <p>
        The Łazienki Palace, surrounded by beautiful gardens, is undoubtedly one of the most beautiful parks in Warsaw. It is an 18th-century palace surrounded by 76 hectares of the urban forest, in the vicinity of which there is also a planetarium, an open-air theatre, pavilions and many other attractions. Other great attractions of this city are the Warsaw Zoo and the Copernicus Science Center, where both younger and older tourists will spend a nice and interesting time.
    </p>

    <p>
        It is also worth going for a walk around Krakowskie Przedmieście, where you can see old tenement houses that were restored after the war, the Nicolaus Copernicus Monument, the Sigismund III Vasa Column, the Presidential Palace and the Polish Academy of Sciences.

    <h3>Top 6 Facts</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>In the Old Town Square, there is a statue of the Mermaid, which, according to legend, defends the city as a gratitude for saving her from the merchant who kidnapped her. Interestingly, the Mermaid is also in the coat of arms of Warsaw, which is found in the first half of the 14th century.</li>
        <li>Warsaw boasts the longest street in Poland. The street is 14.6 km long and its name is Wał Miedzeszyński.</li>
        <li>The Copernicus Science Center is a great place to spend time with children. Both adults and children will find attractions there. Trips to this place come from all over Poland. The garden on the roof of the Center with a wonderful view of the Old Town, the Vistula River and the National Stadium also encourages children to visit this place.</li>
        <li>The Sigismund Column was built in 1644, its erection turned out to be a scandal, as it was the first secular monument in Warsaw. Previously, they were placed only in honour of the Mother of God, Christ and the saints.</li>
        <li>The offer of the Little Spectator Theater is an interesting place for the cultural development of a child. Young children have a nice atmosphere and feel at home thanks to the relaxed atmosphere. The performances are characterized by the fact that children actively participate in them. Selected performances are prepared in such a way that children can participate in them from the age of one. They are not long and last about half an hour.</li>
        <li>The famous composer Chopin was born in Warsaw, and his heart is in the Church of St. The rest of his remains are in Paris.</li>

    <img src="../Assets/images/2) Warsawimage.jpg" alt="WarsawImage2">
    <p>The atmospheric market square is a wonderful square with the famous Warsaw mermaid - the symbol of the city, and beautiful tenement houses with richly decorated facades in warm colours of gold, brown and dirty red. It is never short of people, plus flowers, paintings and everything else you'd expect from a European capital.</p>
  </div>
  
  <div class="textWithImage4">
      <li>Palace in Wilanów</li>
      <img src="../Assets/images/3)Palace.jpg" alt="WarsawImage3">
      <p>The Palace in Wilanów - a district of Warsaw, is located at 10-16 Stanisława Kostki Potockiego Street. It is impossible to miss it, although it is located outside the centre of Warsaw, it is a great place, available in perfect condition, just like most monuments in the capital. The palace is really huge, richly decorated, and there is a well-kept Italian garden and an English park around. The complex was established as the summer residence of King Jan III Sobieski, and today it invites tourists to visit it.</p>

  <h3>The Background</h3>
  <p>
    Masuria - a traditional historical and cultural region of north-eastern Poland, now located within the borders of the Warmian-Masurian Voivodeship. Geographically, it covers the lake districts - Masuria and Iławskie. In modern perception, the name of Masuria is strongly associated with Warmia, and both historical regions that make up the greater part of the voivodeship are sometimes confused with each other, or even unified. Historically, however, there are significant differences.</p>
  <p>
    The Masurian Lake District, a long-time favourite holiday destination of Poles, is filled to the brim with campers, tourists and sailors in the warmer months of the year, when the shimmering stretches of its famous waters shimmer in the rays of the Baltic sun. There are over 2,000 lakes in the area, the largest crowds of which are attracted by Śniardwy (the largest lake in Poland) and Lake Mamry. There are also beautiful rivers and charming towns such as Giżycko, Ełk and Mikołajki. All of them are extremely well-oriented to tourists and guarantee a range of attractions in the form of restaurants, bars and lively promenades.
  </p>

  <p>
    Masuria is one of the best places in Poland to go outside and experience wonderful nature. From canoeing along the picturesque Krutynia River and cycling tours through dense forests, to sailing and fishing on the country's largest lakes, there are plenty to choose from.
  </p>

  <h3>Top 6 Facts</h3>
  <ol>
    <li>Masuria is commonly referred to as the Land of the Great Masurian Lakes or the Land of a Thousand Lakes. While the first name does not surprise anyone, the second name slightly distorts reality. There are about 2,600 lakes in Masuria, which is almost 3 times more than it is usually believed. I wonder how many days it would take to see them all.</li>
    <li>Masurian lakes also stand out from other Polish water reservoirs. The largest lake in Poland is located in Masuria. This is, of course, Śniardwy, with an area of 113.8 km2. In the Land of Great Lakes, there is also the longest lake in Poland, i.e. Jeziorak, which is approximately 27.45 km long.</li>
    <li>Apart from magnificent landscapes, Masuria abounds in places that have been permanently recorded in the history of Poland. Two objects worthy of every historian's attention are certainly the areas of Grunwald, where the memorable battle took place in 1410, and the Wolf's Lair, i.e. Hitler's headquarters in the middle of the forest. Interestingly, in order to hide the quarters, the creators supplemented the defects in the stand with dummy trees made of pipes. For a more natural effect, the pipes are covered with a mesh imitating leaves.</li>
    <li>Although the pyramids are associated mainly with Egypt, you can also find one in Poland. In Masuria, in the town of Rapa, there is a tomb of the family of baron Friedrich von Fahrenheit. Modelled on the Egyptian pyramids, it is almost 16 meters high. Many beliefs and legends have arisen about the Polish pyramid. Some people believe that the pyramid has healing properties, others believe that there are great disturbances in the magnetic field inside.</li>
    <li>The International Scream Competition has been held in Gołdap in Masuria for over 20 years. This event is one of the few competitions of this type in the world. To take part in it, not only Polish residents but also foreigners come to Masuria. What is the contest about? It is enough to shout to a special apparatus for 5 seconds. The best results exceeded the value of 138 dB.</li>
    <li>The Bison Breeding Center is located in the Borecka Forest in Masuria. It is the second-largest centre of this type in Poland. The biggest attraction for tourists is the possibility of watching the bison from the viewing platform, e.g. while feeding. At first, the animals lived in pens, only after they escaped from them into the forest, it was decided that they should be kept in the wild in their natural habitat.</li>

  <h3>My recommendations of places to visit in Masuria</h3> 
  <ul>
  <div class="textWithImage5">
      <li>Boyen Fortress</li>
  <img src="../Assets/images/1.masuriaimage.jpg" alt="Image_1">
  <p>The Boyen Fortress (German: Feste Boyen) lying within the borders of Giżycko is one of the most visited attractions in Masuria. <br> <br> The history of this impressive complex (with an area of approximately 100 ha) dates back to the end of the first half of the 19th century. The cornerstone for the construction was laid on September 4, 1844, and all construction works were completed only in 1875. About 16-17 million bricks were used to build the fortress. The strategic goal of the project was to strengthen the East Prussian defence line in the area of the Great Masurian Lakes. The complex was built on the isthmus between the lakes Kisajno and Niegocin. <br> <br> After the end of World War II, the fortress was used for agricultural purposes. At that time, some of the original buildings were irretrievably lost. Fortunately, many of the buildings, passages and corridors have survived to our times. The last decades have been the revitalization of the complex and its transformation into a tourist attraction. <br> <br> There are three routes of different difficulty for tourists. We can also explore the area on our own, discovering every possible nook and cranny.</p>
</div>
<div class="textWithImage5">
  <li>Giżycko</li>
  <img src="../Assets/images/2.Masuriaimage.jpg" alt="Image_2">
  <p>Giżycko is a typical tourist resort. It has a large accommodation base and a beach. There are many pubs and restaurants in the town, and the local port is full of moored yachts and boats. <br> <br> The most famous attraction of the city is the Boyen Fortress mentioned in the previous point. The Wiewióra rope park, which has several obstacle courses, was created nearby. A popular attraction of the park are zip lines - about 10 different descents have been prepared, 4 of which go directly over the lake. Attention! The park is open only in the summer season. According to the owners' assurances, it is the largest attraction of this type in Masuria. <br> <br> Several historic buildings have been preserved in the centre of Giżycko - all of them can be seen during a short walk. A noteworthy attraction is the observation deck, which was built on the last level of the historic water tower, offering a wonderful view of the Niegocin Lake. <br> <br> Supporters of technical monuments should not miss the opening (or closing) of the swing bridge in Giżycko. The history of the historic crossing dates back to the mid-nineteenth century. What is worth emphasizing - the bridge is opened with a manual mechanism.</p>
</div>
<div class="textWithImage5">
  <li>Masurian Museum in Owczarnia</li>
  <img src="../Assets/images/3.Masuriaimage.jpg" alt="Image_3">
  <p>The Museum in Owczarnia should be a must-see for anyone who would like to learn about the culture and heritage of Masuria, the former inhabitants of these lands. The facility was established on the private initiative of Aleksander Puszko in 1996. Mr Aleksander and his family have been developing the museum for almost 25 years, running a cafe with delicious homemade food. <br> <br> The Museum in Owczarnia was established in a brick building, the history of which dates back to 1850. It was the so-called czworak, i.e. a house for four families (each of them occupied one quarter). In the central part of the building, there was a common black kitchen that has survived to our times in its original state. The building was part of a farm that was razed to the ground by the Russians in 1945. <br> <br> The museum has managed to collect countless exhibits: from everyday objects, through paintings, wooden furniture, kitchen equipment, to weapons and a rich collection of books. There are, among others, to visit living room, normal kitchen, black kitchen, bedroom. <br> <br> What stands out compared to open-air museums in other parts of Poland is the wealth of Masuria. Some of the equipment (such as a real ice refrigerator) shows that thanks to the support of the German state, the standard of living here must have been high. <br> <br> We can visit the facility on our own, but it is best to ask an employee or owners for a tour, who, due to their extensive knowledge, can share many interesting facts. <br> <br> It is worth planning up to 45 minutes to visit the museum. <br> <br> Right next to the museum there is a cafe building, which is also worth visiting - its interior is decorated with a beautiful tiled stove. In the cafe, we can rest for a while, have a drink or a snack, and even buy local cold-pressed oil. In the summer season, the owners cook homemade dinners. We ordered dumplings and kartacze - both dishes were delicious.</p>
</div>
<div class="textWithImage5">
  <li>Leśniewo Górne Rope Park</li>
  <img src="../Assets/images/4.Masuriaimage.jpg" alt="Image_4">
  <p>The Leśniewo Górne lock does not fulfil the function of another monument-museum today. On the contrary - the building was turned into a rope park! Two basic attractions await visitors: a zip-line ride and ... a swing jump into the airlock itself! There are two versions of the jump available - from the lower (15 m) and the higher (20 m) platform. The ropes course is an ideal place for anyone who would like to raise their adrenaline level. <br> <br> Before we go down on the zipline or jump inside the airlock, we still have to get to the top of the structure. We can choose a double-rope bridge and a suspended, movable footbridge made of ropes and boards. <br> <br> The jump itself takes only seconds, but the fun is great. We, despite the fear of heights, checked all the variants and had a great time - although it was not without a lot of stress!</p>

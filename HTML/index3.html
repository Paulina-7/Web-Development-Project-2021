    <h3>The Background</h3>
    <p>
        The Tatra Mountains, together with the Tatra National Park, located in south-central Poland, constitute a natural border between Slovakia and Poland, although most of the mountain range is located in Slovakia. Established in 1954, the park consists mainly of forests, meadows and numerous rock formations covering the Tatra Mountains. On the Polish side of the park, there are over 270 km of hiking trails that are visited by thousands of tourists seeking mountain hikes every year.
    </p>

    <p>
        The highest peak in Poland is Rysy, located in the Polish Tatras. They are 2,500 meters high and are also the highest peak of the Tatra Mountains in both countries. You can easily go to the top on your own, and the hike takes about 12 hours, while the views from the top compensate for every effort put into climbing. In addition, there are over 600 caves in the park, the longest (23 kilometres) and deepest (824 meters) is Wielka Śnieżna. There are also over 30 alpine lakes in the park and the Wielka Siklawa waterfall, which is 70 meters high.
    </p>

    <p>
        Morskie Oko is the largest lake in the park. It is located deep in the park and can be reached after almost a two-hour hike through the hills and thick pine forest. Morskie Oko is one of the most popular and iconic places in the Tatras, visited by over 50,000 tourists a year. Although probably everyone knows them perfectly well, it is worth going back there and making sure that the visit is completed in both summer, and winter (in the winter months, the reservoir freezes).
    </p>

    <p>
        According to legend, the lake was connected with the sea by an underground corridor, hence the name "Morskie Oko". The peaks of the Tatra Mountains surrounding the lake rise to the highest altitude in Poland and guarantee beautiful views. The hike to Morskie Oko from Palenica Białczańska takes two hours, which is a distance of 8 kilometres. Many tourists decide to ride a horse-drawn cart to Wlosienica, from where there is only 1.5 km to go. At the top, there are two shelters that will help you spend more time exploring the surrounding mountain trails that guarantee beautiful views and contact with nature.

    <h3>My recommendations of places to visit in Tatra Mountains</h3> 
    <ul>
    <div class="textWithImage3">
        <li>Picturesque Valleys</li>
    <img src="../Assets/images/1. Tatryimage.jpg" alt="TatryImage1">
    <p>There are many easily accessible valleys in the Polish Tatras. One of the most beautiful is the Kościeliska Valley in the Western Tatras, its picturesque nature is determined by fantastic rock formations, steep cliffs and slopes, vast clearings, caves and gorges. Walking along its bottom, we will pass the characteristic narrowings, the so-called rock gates. <br> <br> Also worth seeing are the short mountain valleys near Zakopane, for example Za Bramką, Strążyska, Ku Dzurka, Biały. They look most interesting in autumn when the beeches overgrowing the forest take on fantastic colours. Rapid streams flow in almost all of them, filling them with noise and enhancing their charm. The Zakopane Valleys, due to their easy access and low difficulty, can be recommended to everyone, especially to people with children. These short valleys can be visited at any time of the year. <br> <br> More demanding tourists should see Hala Gąsienicowa and the Valley of Five Polish Ponds. It is there that you can see typical alpine landscapes. The valleys in the Tatras are made easier by a network of hiking trails that often lead to high peaks and a mountain pass.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="textWithImage3">
        <li>Mountain Lakes</li>
    <img src="../Assets/images/2. Tatryimage.jpg" alt="TatryImage2">
    <p>The most beautiful elements of the Tatra Mountains landscape include lakes, called here ponds. Most of them are located on the upper floors of the valleys of the High Tatras, on the Polish side, there are about 30 of them. Picturesquely situated Tatra lakes are characterized by exceptional transparency. <br> <br> In the Polish, Tatras lies Morskie Oko, one of the most magnificent ones, which attracts many tourists with its beauty. Located in a deep cauldron, it is a mirror where you can see the surrounding lofty peaks. Being in this place, it is worth going higher to admire the Czarny Staw pod Rysami, its waters have unprecedented transparency of up to 17 meters. The jewel of the Polish part of the Tatra Mountains is the Valley of Five Polish Ponds, where we can admire mountain lakes surrounded by lofty peaks. The total area of the water reservoirs located here is as much as 61 ha. <br> <br> The largest concentration of Tatra lakes in the Polish Tatras is Dolina Gąsienicowa. There are as many as 21 mountain lakes in this Tatra lake district. The most beautiful and at the same time the largest of them is situated at the foot of Kościelec - Czarny Gąsienicowy Pond. The second-largest pond in the Gąsienicowa Valley is Zielony Staw on the other side. The lakes can be easily reached by the marked trail from Kuźnice through Hala Gąsienicowa. <br> <br> The only one open to the public in the Western Tatras is the Smreczyński Pond. The water reservoir located in the Kościeliska Valley is easily accessible for tourists. For many years, you can observe mallard ducks at the Tatra ponds in spring and summer.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="textWithImage3">
      <li>Tatra Underground</li>
      <img src="../Assets/images/3. Tatryimage.jpg" alt="TatryImage3">
      <p>One of the most interesting elements of Tatra nature are numerous caves and ravines. There are about 750 caves in the Polish Tatras, mainly in the Western Tatras. The largest, longest and deepest is the Great Snowy Cave and the Great Litworowa Cave system. The whole of the known corridors is approx. 24 km and the depth from the hole to its bottom reaches as much as 814 m. <br> <br> There are 6 caves available for tourists in the Polish Tatras, most of which are located in the Kościeliska Valley. These are the caves: Mroźna (the only illuminated one), Smocza Jama, Mylna, Raptawicka, Obłazkowa and Dziura located close to Zakopane in the mountain valley Ku Dziura. <br> <br> Access to the openings and the areas open to tourists are properly insured (clamps and chains) and marked. When going to the underground corridors, you must remember that all caves, except Mroźna, are dark, they are damp, wet, especially after rainfall, and low temperature. As a result, there is a lot of mud in the caves and dirt should be taken into account. You will need flashlights and preferably headlamps, those in phones may not be enough, moreover, in this case, the batteries run out quickly. <br> <br> A trip to the Tatra caves can be a good alternative when the weather is not favourable for going out to the higher parts of the mountains. We recommend visiting the Tatra underground to everyone, especially people with children, for whom it will be an amazing attraction.</p>

  <div class="textWithImage3">
      <li>Waterfalls</li>
      <img src="../Assets/images/4. TatryImage.jpg" alt="TatryImage4">
      <p>In the Tatra Mountains, a swift stream flows in almost every valley. The strong breakdown of the slope of the streams on the rock thresholds causes the formation of cascades and waterfalls. <br> <br> The most famous and picturesque are: Wodogrzmoty Mickiewicza, Siklawa and Siklawica. The largest waterfall of the Polish Tatras is Siklawa, it is formed by the Roztoka stream flowing from Wielki Staw in the Valley of Five Polish Ponds. The waterfall falls in two streams, splashing with numerous cascades. It can be seen from the trail running from the Roztoka Valley to the Valley of 5 Polish Ponds. <br> <br> The fastest way to reach the charming Siklawica waterfall in the Strążyska Valley. A picturesque cascade descends in two almost vertical rock walls, the upper fault is 10 meters and the lower one is 12 meters high. In winter, during severe frosts, the waterfall freezes and takes the form of an icefall.</p>

  <div class="textWithImage3">
      <li>Glades with Crocuses</li>
      <img src="../Assets/images/5. Tatryimage.jpg" alt="TatryImage5">
      <p>In the Tatra Mountains, there are about a hundred clearings on the regie floor. They were created mostly by human activity, who, while gaining new spaces, cut down ancient trees, and cleared the land for crops and pastoralism. <br> <br> The Tatra glades are overgrown with a variety of vegetation, and in spring they are most associated with crocuses. The flowers that grow in mass are delightful, covering the meadows fertilized by sheep with a lilac carpet. <br> <br> There are several such places in the Tatras, the most famous are Kalatówki and the Chochołowska Valley, but crocuses in the Tatra Mountains are also found in the Kościeliska Valley and the clearing under Kopieniec. Crocuses appear in clearings in early spring in places of melted snow.</p>

    <div class="textWithImage3">
        <li>Shepherding</li>
        <img src="../Assets/images/6. Tatryimage.jpg" alt="TatryImage6">
        <p>In the area of the Tatra Mountains, pastoralism and related rituals are still alive. The so-called Cultural Sheep Grazing. You can see herds of sheep grazing on individual clearings from spring to autumn. Such places include the Kościeliska Valley, Chochołowska Valley, Kuźnice, Rusinowa Polana and Kalatówki.<br> <br> Sheep's milk products are made traditionally in shepherds' huts or special shepherd's huts. Until now, the preserved huts are an interesting element of the Tatra landscape, they can be found in many places in the Tatra Mountains. <br> <br> The largest clusters have been preserved in the following clearings: Chochołowska Niżnia, Kopieniec, Rusinowa. The most picturesque huts are on Hala Gąsienicowa and Polana Stoły. One of the oldest pastoral buildings is the stone hut in the Valley of the Five Polish Ponds.</p>

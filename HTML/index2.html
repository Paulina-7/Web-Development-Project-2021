  <h3>The Background</h3>
  <p>
    Krakow is one of the oldest cities in Poland that was inhabited already in the 7th century. Krakow is located on the major Polish river, the Vistula, and surrounded by the Carpathian Podgorze and the Lesser Poland Upland. No chronicles mention the beginnings of the former capital of Poland. Medieval legend says that the city was founded by King Krak, who defeated the terrible dragon living in a large cave located in the rocky foundation of Wawel Hill. It is known, however, that man appeared in today's Krakow as early as in prehistory. As shown by archaeological research, this took place about 200 thousand years ago. Thanks to the fertile lands, forests abundant in wild animals, the proximity of the river, and convenient communication location, people eagerly settled in this area.
  </p>

  <p>
    From the earliest times, Krakow played the role of one of the most significant centres of the state of the Vistula, that is, the people living in the early Middle Ages areas in the basin of the upper Vistula. The first mention of the existence of Krakow in written sources is the account of Ibrahim ibn Jakub from the years 965-966. A Spanish Jew who visited Krakow during his journey from Toroza to Magdeburg.
  </p>

  <p>
    In 977 King Mieszko I took Krakow and separated the "state of Krakow", which he gave to his son Boleslaw the Brave. After Mieszko's death, his son took over the power in the country, and Krakow became the most important city. However, it was not until June 5, 1257, during the reign of Bolesław the Chaste, that Krakow was granted the location privilege under the Magdeburg Law. Thanks to him, the checkerboard layout of the city's buildings was created, and the townspeople gained numerous privileges. It was also then that the Main Market Square was established, which is Krakow's pride to this day.

  <h3>Top 4 Facts</h3>
  <ol>
  <li>
    Considering the fact that Krakow escaped most of the devastation caused by the outbreak of World War II, which drastically hit other Polish cities such as Warsaw, for example, Krakow's Old Town centre still retains its amazing medieval architecture. The Wawel Castle and the historic district of Kazimierz, also known as the Old Jewish Quarter, have been inscribed on the UNESCO World Heritage List and are also the most visited attractions in Krakow.
  </li>
  <li>
    There are about 40 city parks in Krakow, including the 19th-century Planty, which covers an area of over 200,000 square meters and forms a green circle around the city centre. Another equally fascinating place is Wolski Forest, located just a few minutes from the city centre, where there are many hiking and cycling routes in a vast forest area. 
  </li>
  <li>
    On rainy days, it is worth visiting many Krakow museums, especially the National Wawel Collection, where you can see furniture from that era, a huge collection of Flemish tapestries, royal jewels and a collection of weapons and armour from the 15th century. On the other hand, an extremely in-depth look at the former Krakow and its streets can be seen in the Market Square Underground Museum.
  </li>
  <li>
    Many of the area's main attractions are outside the city and are often taken as day trips. Noteworthy points are the oldest operating salt mine in the world, Wieliczka, and the Auschwitz-Birkenau concentration camps.

  <h3>My recommendations of places to visit in Krakow</h3> 
  <ul>
  <div class="textWithImage2">
  <li>Colourful Stairs in Krakow</li>
  <img src="../Assets/images/1)Stairs_in_Krakow.jpg" alt="Photo_1">
  <p>In Krakow, it is worth going off the beaten path from time to time, getting out of the wild crowd heading to Wawel and discovering extraordinary places. One of such cool places in Krakow is Tatrzańska street in Podgorze, where you will find colourful stairs with various quotes. You can find here wisdom and maxims from Gandhi, Woody Allen or Papa Moomin. 55 stars were painted as part of the PArtBoom Festival to give a slightly anonymous public space. The colourful stairs in Podgorze are one of my favourite, non-obvious attractions of Krakow, and I highly recommend you visit them!</p>
  </div>
  <div class="textWithImage2">
  <li>St. Mary's Trumpet Call in Krakow</li>
  <img src="../Assets/images/2) Trumpet_Call.webp" alt="Photo_2">
  <p>In my opinion, the trumpet call of St. Mary is Krakow's most popular attraction. Why do you ask? Ah, because it's probably the most mysterious melody in the world. Nobody knows who composed it, when exactly it was created and how trumpeters were taught to play. In some historical records, you can find information that the trumpet call was played from the church tower long before Columbus discovered America! The guards in the tower of St. Mary's Church were to play the trumpet call at dawn and at dusk to indicate the opening and closing of the city gates. In addition, the guard sounded the alarm in the event of a fire and during the war, when the enemy was approaching the walls of Krakow. Then the tradition of playing the bugle call every hour to four corners of the world, cultivated to this day, was born. <br> <br> Like everything in Krakow, the trumpet call of St. Mary also has its own legend. During the Tatar invasion in 1241, Batu Khan's army approached Krakow, but an alert trumpeter alerted the crew with a trumpet call. The city defended itself victoriously against the invasion, but the brave guard was struck by a Tatar arrow and did not finish the tune. Since then, in commemoration of this event, the trumpet call stops at exactly the same point as in 1241.</p>

<div class="textWithImage2">
  <li>Chimera Salad Bar in Krakow</li>
  <img src="../Assets/images/3)Chimera_Restaurant.jpg" alt="Photo_3">
  <p>The Chimera Salad Bar is my gastronomic temple. I discovered it when I was on a trip to Krakow, and now whenever I get the chance to travel to Krakow, I always visit it. From among thousands of eating places in Krakow, Chimera has always been, is and will always be number one. Only here for a dozen or so zlotys (Polish currency), you can try amazing salads, vegetable tarts and delicious baked potatoes. Moreover, all this is found in a fantastically furnished restaurant in the backyard. <br> <br> It's hard to find a free table at lunchtime, but for a Chimeran broccoli tart, you can sacrifice yourself and eat standing up. So if you feel hungry while exploring the city, let your feet carry you to St. Anna 3.</p>
</div>
<div class="textWithImage2">
  <li>The Street Art in Krakow</li> 
  <img src="../Assets/images/4) Krakow-street-art.jpg" alt="Photo_4">
  <p>Visiting Krakow is not only the most important and historical attraction. But it is worth getting to know the city from a more modern side and looking for street art, which looks quite original in Krakow. In the aforementioned Kazimierz district, look carefully around the walls and alleys, because there are some pretty cool works - from large murals to small inscriptions that melt every heart that is sensitive to street art.</p>
</div>
<div class="textWithImage2">
  <li>Wawel Royal Castle</li>
  <img src="../Assets/images/5)Wawel_Castle.jpg" alt="Photo_5">
  <p>Take the queue and visit the Wawel Royal Castle! So what if there are gigantic queues and lots of people there? You can sacrifice yourself once in a while. Wawel is one of the most important historical places in Poland! For centuries it was the seat of Polish kings, and its construction was made by those who young Poles learn about in history lessons - Bolesław the Brave and Zygmunt the Old. Even if you do not like visiting castles or strongholds, you will change your mind at Wawel - this place is simply amazing. Not only do the museum collections contain valuable royal insignia, but also the kings of Poland are buried in the Wawel cathedral church. <br> <br> In addition, it is worth visiting Wawel, because according to legend, there is a secret place of power and a stone that gives magical energy. There is also a dragon that breathes fire and a Zygmunt bell that rings on the most important national holidays and celebrations, as well as at moments important for our country. You should devote an entire day to visiting Wawel Hill. And it won't be a day wasted!</p>

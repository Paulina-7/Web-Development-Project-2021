                <h2>1. Problem Description</h2>
                <p>
                    For my web development project, I will create a travel blog. A travel blog is simply a blog where the entire focus is on the area of travel. It is a type of website that is updated regularly in the form of posts and blogs. My travel blog will focus on four places that I have travelled to in Poland such as Krakow, Tatra Mountains, Warsaw and Masuria.
                </p>
                <p>
                    On the home page, I will create a menu bar on the top, where an end-user can find the links to register, log in, to contact the blog's creator, the project report and the four blogs. In the banner area, I will place an image with the flag of Poland, and in the middle, I will put a banner that welcomes the users to the blog. Afterwards, I will describe the main objective of my website which is showing to the potential user four areas in Poland that are worth seeing. I will place four posts that will advertise my four blogs of the tourist guides for each place. Moreover, on the right side of the page, I will add four boxes that will display a photo and information about the creator of the website, categories, popular posts and popular tags. Ultimately, at the bottom of this page, I will embed a Google map that will display four pinned places in Poland which I will talk about in my blog.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The second page will be my first blog about Krakow. It will have the same header and footer sections as the home page. At the top, I will provide a photo gallery that will display nine places or monuments in the city of Krakow. The gallery will be created in a slideshow way so that when the user clicks the arrow, it will change an image. After that, there will be the background section where I will describe the very basic history of Krakow. Then there will be the facts section, where I will describe four facts about Krakow. Next, there will be the recommendations section where I will list five places in Krakow that I recommend visiting. Subsequently, I will add a YouTube video that will show ten shocking things about Krakow. Below that, I will create a table of costs for accommodation in a hostel, meals, transport and attractions for the weekend in Krakow. I will list the prices in both zloty (Polish currency) and Euro. Finally, I will make a comment section where the user can send their comment with their name and email.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The third page will be my second blog about the Tatra Mountains. It will have the same header and footer sections as the home page. At the top, I will provide a photo gallery that will display twelve images from the Tatra Mountains. When the user puts the mouse cursor at the image, the photo will tilt a little. Similarly to the first blog, I will describe the background section where I will present some historical and geographic backgrounds of the Tatra Mountains. Then I will list six facts about this area. Subsequently, there will be the recommendations section where I will list six places in the Tatra Mountains that I recommend visiting. Once again, I will add a YouTube video that will show the places in this area worth visiting. Like in the previous blog, I will add a table of costs for accommodation in a hostel, meals, transport and attractions for the weekend in the Tatra Mountains. The prices will be also listed in both zloty (Polish currency) and Euro. Ultimately, at the bottom, there will be the comment box.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The fourth page will be my third blog about Warsaw. It will have the same header and footer sections as the home page. At the top, I will provide a photo gallery that will display ten places in Warsaw. When the user puts the mouse cursor at the image, the photo zooms and changes colour to grey. Similarly to the previous blogs, I will describe the background section where I will present some historical background of Warsaw. Then I will list six facts about this city. Subsequently, there will be the recommendations section where I will list three places in Warsaw that I recommend visiting. Once again, I will add a YouTube video that shows a Warsaw vacation travel guide. Like in the last blogs, I will put a table of costs for accommodation in a hostel, meals, transport and attractions for the weekend in Warsaw. The prices will be as well listed in both zloty (Polish currency) and Euro. Lastly, at the bottom, there will be the comment box.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The fifth page will be my fourth blog about Masuria. It will have the same header and footer sections as the home page. At the top, I will provide a photo gallery that will display eleven places in the Masuria region. The gallery will be created in a slideshow form, so it will change images automatically. Similarly to the previous blogs, I will describe the background section where I will present some historical and geographic backgrounds of Masuria. Then I will list six facts about this region. Subsequently, there will be the recommendations section where I will list four places in Masuria that I recommend visiting. Once again, I will add a YouTube video that will show beautiful places in Masuria. Like in the last blogs, I will add a table of costs for accommodation in a hostel, meals, transport and attractions for the weekend in Warsaw. The prices will be as well listed in both zloty (Polish currency) and Euro. Lastly, at the bottom, there will also be the comment box.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The archetypal users of my website will be individuals in the 12+ age group because I think most people over the age of twelve are interested and enjoy travelling and visiting new places with their school, friends or family.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I believe my travel blog website will solve many problems. The most significant one is that my blog is aimed specifically at people who would like to travel to Poland but are not entirely sure what places are worth visiting. By checking my travel blog for recommendations, and so on, the potential end-user might be encouraged to visit the areas which I will present on my website even if they might have been nervous and reticent before. In addition, I think that my travel blog also will introduce the end-user to places and adventures they might not even know existed so it would expand their list for future holiday destinations.

                <h2>2. Research</h2>
                <p>
                    For my web development project, I researched three websites that are similar to my travel blog site. The first website is an English travel blog where the bloggers illustrate many places from all over the world. The second website similarly to the first one is also an English travel blog where the blogger depicts stories from various countries that he travelled to. The third website is a Polish travel blog where the blogger tells her adventures she experienced in various places she visited.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The first website is called Travel Blog. Firstly I think that this website is fairly easy to use for the user. The links and images load at a good pace. It is easy to find any information you want since it is rightly divided in the menu bar at the top of the home page. Also, the search bar makes it easier to search for a specific topic on this website. Secondly, I think this website meets its identifiable purpose which is demonstrating many places around the world and describing their geographic information or highlights. Finally, I believe this website is well designed because it has easily readable text, it has good visual appeal and the content is very informative and interesting.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The second website is called Maptia. First of all, I as a user found this website very easy to operate. The links load at a good pace. It is really easy to find anything you want since it is divided into three sections in the menu bar at the top of the home page. Also, the search bar makes it easier to search for a specific topic on the website. Besides, I believe that this website meets its purpose as it displays very intriguing content with wonderful images. Lastly, I find this website well-developed and designed because it has easy to read text and the visual appeal is great.

                <p>
                    The third website is called Travel Story. To begin, in my opinion, this website is really easy to use as well. The links in the side menu bar load at a good pace, and it is very easy to find everything. Also, the search bar makes it easier to search for a specific topic on the website. Furthermore, I think that this website definitely meets its purpose as it presents to users very informative and interesting content with beautiful images. Ultimately, I find this website wonderfully designed as it has pretty visual appeal and also the text is very easy to read.

                <h2>3. Technology Selection and Site Architecture</h2>
                <p>
                    For my website, I will use the newest versions of HTML and CSS which are HTML5 and CSS3. HTML5 will enrich the semantic content of my website pages, new page structure elements such as main, section, header, footer and nav are also added. CSS 3 also brings several new styles that weren't previously seen in older versions. One great new class styling attribute is the rounded borders I could add to tables or div tags. The border-radius attribute defines the depth of roundness on a border. Finally, another common CSS 3 attribute is the shadowing effect. Shadows also give the buttons, text or div tags some depth and a 3-dimensional feel. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    For my website, I planned a standard blog layout so that on the home page there will be a menu bar at the top, then the banner and then the posts. Then the other pages will be full of content, images, videos and so on. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    For my blogs, I will use a variety of warm colours in order to make my website eye-catching to a potential user. In general, I plan to use the Times New Roman and Serif fonts since they are simply looking fonts. I will add a lot of various images and videos in order to enhance my website design. I will make the website responsive with cross-browser compatibility so that the user will be able to view my blog on any device like a phone, tablet or laptop and on any browser.
                </p>

                <h2>4. JavaScript Functionality</h2>
                <p>
                    For the home page of my website, I firstly will do the let menu = document.querySelector("#menu-bars) and then let navbar = document.querySelector('.navbar'). This function will return the first element within the document that matches the specified selectors. Then I will do the menu.onclick. This attribute will work when the user clicks on the button in the menu bar. When the user's mouse clicks on the element then the script runs. Next, I will do the let searchIcon and searchForm which will return the first element within the document that matches the specified selectors. Then I will do the search icon.onclick. This attribute the same as the previous one will work when the user clicks on the button.
                </p>
                <p>
                    For my second blog on my website, I will also do var slideIndex = 1; showSlides(slideIndex); in order to display a slideshow. Moreover, for the fifth blog on my website, I will do var currentSlide = 0; / const slides = document.querySelectorAll(".slide"). This will create an automatic slideshow.
                </p>
                <p>
                    For my contact form page, I will do the function validForm and form validation so that the form must be checked to make sure all the mandatory fields are filled in. If a form field (name) is empty, this function will alert a message, and will return false, to prevent the form from being submitted. Moreover, I will do functions such as if(!email.value.match(/^([\w-\.]+@([\w-]+\.)+[\w-]{2,4})?$/) || email.value == "") so that if the user doesn't type @ for example in the email section, it will return false.
                </p>

                <img src="../My Report/Assets/images/Wireframe5.jpg">

                <p>
                    I designed the wireframes for my five website pages. On the first page, I created the menu bar, the header, the banner, some content, the posts with images and some text, a map and the footer. On the second, third, fourth and fifth pages, I created the menu bar, the header, the banner, the content with images, videos, comment box and the footer. All website pages except the homepage are designed in the same format. The only differences are the content, the images, video, etc.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In my opinion, the content of each page is very informative and enjoyable to read for a potential user. Moreover, I think the layout of the website is rightly set and divided so that it will be easy for an end-user to find relevant information that they might look for.

                <h2>6. Development Plan</h2>
                <p>
                    Firstly I will create a folder for my project and add inside sub-folder called Assets and then by its own index.html. Then I will add folders such as css, images and js to the Assets folder. Secondly, I will type out the HTML code layout on Visual Studio Code. Afterwards, I will research and download appropriate images for my website. Thirdly, I will research and then embed relevant videos from YouTube to my blog pages. Finally, I will type out the content for each page. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    I will apply the same CSS file to each of my five pages so that it will be reused and I will hold it in an external stylesheet. I will style all my pages with the CSS. I will style the pages' background, images, video, as well as the font family, font size, font-weight, color, padding, margin, position, display, width and height to enhance my website design. However, in order to keep each website a little different, I will use specificity, like nested classes, or selectors.

                <p>
                    I will test my HTML markups with the HTML Validator on a website called Free For Matter. Through it, I will check if the HTML file and all links on all pages of my website are valid.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I will test my CSS file with the CSS Validator on a website called Code Beautify. Through it, I will check if the CSS markup is valid.
                </p>
                <p>
                    To check if my website is cross-browser compatible, I will open my website on various browsers such as Google Chrome and Microsoft Edge to see if the website displays on each browser the same way.

                <h2>8. Site Evaluation</h2>
                <p>
                    First of all, I evaluated my website by the method of the match between the system and the real world. I made sure that the text and language on my website is familiar to the users of the site. Moreover, I made sure that the information on my website is presented clearly and logically.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Secondly, I evaluated my website by the method of consistency and standards. I checked if the layout and design of my website follow conventions of standard designs. I also compared the content, design and operation of my website with similar travel blogs that I have already identified above. I checked if my website looks professionally designed. Therefore, I believe my website meets the standards of a typical travel blog website because it has all relevant characteristics and information.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Thirdly, I evaluated my website by the method of relevance. I made sure that my website is appropriate for my audience age target. I checked that the content is well written and free of grammatical and spelling errors, but with some emotive language and imagery. Also that it has the right amount of information in order not to overwhelm the potential user.
                </p>
                <p>
                   Finally, I evaluated my website by the method of flexibility and efficiency of use. I made sure that my website is designed to cater for both experienced and inexperienced users. Nevertheless, frequent and experienced users should be able to use my site in an efficient manner.
